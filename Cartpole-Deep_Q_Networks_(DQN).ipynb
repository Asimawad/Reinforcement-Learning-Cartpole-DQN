This can pose a problem because at the start of training, the Q-network will be very inaccurate (i.e. a bad aproximation of the true Q-function) and the agent will consistently choose suboptimal actions. Moreover, the agent will never deviate from its suboptimal strategy and discover new, potentially more rewarding  actions. As a result, the Q-network remains inaccurate. Ideally, the agent should try out many different strategies in the beginning so that it can observe the outcomes (rewards) of its actions in different states and so improve its approximation of the Q-function.\n",

However, as the accuracy of the Q-network improves, the agent should start taking fewer random actions and instead start choosing greedy actions with respect to the Q-values. Choosing the best actions given the current Q-network is referred to as **exploitation**. In RL, we typically denote the ratio of random to greedy actions by the value **epsilon** $\\varepsilon$. Epsilon is usually a decimal value in the interval $[0,1]$, where for example $\\varepsilon=0.4$ means that the agent chooses a random action 40% of the time and the greedy action 60% of the time. It is common in RL to linearly (or exponentially) decrease the value of epsilon over time so that the agent becomes increasingly greedy as the accuracy of its Q-network improves through learning.\n",

Note, LunarLander is a significantly more challenging environment than CartPole. Therefore, you will likely need to experiment quite a bit to find the best hyperparameters for DQN, and possibly increase the number of training episodes in order to learn a good policy. In LunarLander, the environment is considered solved when the agent can reliably achieve an episode return of 200.\n",
